A collection of open source Java projects developed in relation to the content hosted at:

http://www.tomgibara.com

It currently contains the following projects.

## Stupp ##

**Stupp** is a small Java library for mocking-up the persistence of interface-based data models in unit tests.

More information will become available here in time:

http://www.tomgibara.com/projects/stupp

## Money ##

**Money** is a very small Java package (containing just three classes) that provides useful abstractions for recording, computing and formatting monetary amounts. It was developed because I couldn't find any decent money abstractions for Java.

All the relevant project information is available here:

http://www.tomgibara.com/projects/money

But if you want to cut-to-the-chase, a maven generated site that contains all the usual information and reports is hosted here:

## Crinch ##

**Crinch** is a Java project that is accumulating my classes for compact data representations. The project homepage is here:
